		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>Through my project experience and coursework, I have cultivated a passion for data analysis. I have practiced Exploratory Data Analysis skills through first-hand experience in cleaning and analyzing datasets that I hope to leverage to help clients improve their businesses. I would also love the opportunity to use my language skills to connect to more people, whether it be professionally or in my everyday life.</p><br>
		<p>I grew up in Grand Rapids, MI and attended Forest Hills Northern High School. I have spoken Spanish since kindergarten and have always enjoyed learning about language and culture. I have always known I wanted to pursue a Spanish degree in college, but I did not realize my passion for data until I came to University of Michigan.</p><br>
		<p>My dual-degree has provided many unique opportunities to learn and grow personally and professionally. My SI coursework has given me first-hand experience to develop the technical and teamwork skills necessary for success in an analyst position through meaningful projects. I have developed analytical skills in Python, using Pandas, NumPy and SQL to clean and manipulate data, as well as visualization skills through Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh. I also have predictive analysis experience using Scikit-learn. I am currently working on my Capstone project in a team of 3 other students. We are helping the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Motorcycle & ATV sector identify compliance issues among manufacturers by scraping data from an online forum and comparing it to internal data provided by the EPA. Our deliverable will be a report detailing any relationships or discrepancies we see in the data to help prevent manufacturers from taking advantage of the EPA in the future.</p><br>
		<p>In pursuit of my Spanish degree, I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Granada, Spain. While abroad, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern at a local company called Conecta13. My job consisted of analyzing data from their online education platform and reporting the outcomes of my analysis to measure user participation in the program. I used Python and SQLite to gather and analyze the data and delivered a report with statistics and analysis regarding the students using the platform.</p><br>
